<p><strong>History of Z&#8217;malet El Emir Abdelkader (formerly Taguine)</strong></p>



<p>The region has been inhabited since ancient times by the Gaetuli who, far from Roman and Byzantine influence, led a nomadic lifestyle and traveled across a vast territory stretching from Mauritania to Tunisia. These warrior peoples carried out raids and frequently came into conflict with the Romanized Berbers of Tell and the Roman or Byzantine authorities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The Provinces of the Regency of Algiers</em></p>



<p><strong>Origin and Evolution of the Name</strong><br>The commune of Z&#8217;malet El Emir Abdelkader, located in the wilaya of Tiaret, was formerly known as Taguine. It was renamed in honor of Emir Abdelkader, an emblematic figure of the Algerian resistance against French colonization in the 19th century.</p>



<p>The word &#8220;Z&#8217;malet&#8221; refers to the zmalas, which were traveling camps that housed the families, fighters, and possessions of Emir Abdelkader during his fight against the French army.</p>



<p><strong>Organization of the Smala</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The Smala of Emir Abdelkader</em></p>



<p>Emir Abdelkader always organized the smala according to the same principle: it consisted of four circular and concentric enclosures where each douar, each family, each individual had their fixed and marked place, according to their rank, usefulness, functions, or the trust they inspired. Upon the smala arriving at its shelter, the emir&#8217;s tent was pitched in the center of the area that the camp was to cover.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It was immediately surrounded by the tents of Abdelkader&#8217;s intimate servants and principal relatives, who composed the first enclosure: five douars.</li>



<li>The second included the douars of Khalifa Ben Allal and his relatives, those of the regular infantry, and a few important chiefs: ten douars. </li>



<li>The third was formed by the Hachem-Cherraga and the Hachem-Gharaba: 207 douars. The fourth enclosure, located more or less close to the main enclosures, depending on the terrain, water, woods, or pastures, was formed by seven nomadic tribes who served as guides and protection for the smala in the desert: 146 douars.</li>



<li>This makes a total of 368 douars, each with fifteen to twenty tents. The population of this itinerant city can be estimated at twenty thousand souls, and the number of fighters armed with rifles at five thousand, including five hundred regular infantrymen and two thousand cavalrymen.<br></li>

<p><strong>The Capture of the Abdelkader Smala (1843): A Major Event</strong><br>The most significant event in the history of the region was the capture of the Abdelkader Smala by French forces on May 16, 1843.</p>



<p><strong>Historical Context</strong><br>Since 1832, Emir Abdelkader had been waging a war of resistance against the French occupation. To escape enemy attacks, he had organized a smala, a vast nomadic community of several thousand people:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>His fighters and their families.</li>



<li>Artisans, scholars, and religious leaders.</li>



<li>Livestock, wealth, and military resources.</li>
</ul>



<p>In May 1843, the smala was established in the region of Taguine (present-day Z&#8217;malet El Émir Abdelkader).</p>



<p><br><strong>The Duke of Aumale&#8217;s Attack</strong><br>The smala had spent the end of the winter of 1843 two days&#8217; march south of Tagdempt. Informed that they were being pursued, they wandered for some time and found themselves at the source of the Taguine on May 16. Governor-General Bugeaud had been informed of the smala&#8217;s presence near Boghari (present-day Ksar El Boukhari, Wilaya of Médéa), but their location was unknown. He ordered General Lamoricière and the Duke of Aumale to pursue him. The prince set out from Boghari with 1,300 infantrymen and 600 horses. Three days later, he learned that the tribe was 80 kilometers south of Goudjila (present-day Nadorah, Wilaya of Tiaret). To reach it, they had to travel twenty leagues without a drop of water. While the soldiers were searching for the Taguine spring to quench their thirst, the bachagha Ahmar ben Ferhat (bachagha of the Ayad ouled, Theniet El Had) came to inform the prince of the unexpected presence of the tribe at this same spring.</p>

<p><strong>Biography of Emir Abdelkader</strong></p>



<p><strong>Emir Abdelkader (1808-1883): Hero of the Algerian Resistance and Humanist</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a class="glightbox" href="https://taguine14.netlify.app/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2F1000007761.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75"><img decoding="async" src="https://taguine14.netlify.app/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2F1000007761.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75" alt=""/></a></figure></div>


<p>Emir Abdelkader is an emblematic figure in the history of Algeria and the Arab world. A military leader, statesman and thinker, he is recognized for his resistance to French colonization and for his humanist values.</p>



<p><strong>Early Life and Education</strong><br>Born in 1808 in the Mascara region (Algeria), Abdelkader belonged to a religious and scholarly family of the Qadiriyya Sufi brotherhood. From a young age, he received a thorough education in theology, philosophy and military sciences. He traveled to Mecca, Egypt and other Muslim countries, thus strengthening his knowledge and leadership.</p>



<p><strong>Resistance against French Colonization (1832-1847)</strong><br>Faced with the French invasion in 1830, the Algerian tribes sought a leader. In 1832, Abdelkader was proclaimed emir by several tribal chiefs in western Algeria. He organized the resistance and founded a state with a structured administration, a regular army and an effective diplomatic policy.</p>



<p>He won several victories against the French, thanks in particular to his knowledge of the terrain and his guerrilla tactics. However, faced with French military power and internal betrayals, he was forced to surrender in 1847 after the destruction of his bases by French forces.</p>



<p><strong>Exile and Humanist Commitment</strong><br>After his surrender, he was imprisoned in France (at the Château d&#8217;Amboise) until 1852. Freed by Napoleon III, he settled in Damascus (Syria), where he devoted himself to study and spirituality.</p>



<p>In 1860, he saved thousands of Christians during the intercommunal massacres in Damascus, which earned him international tributes, notably from France and the Pope.</p>



<p><strong>Legacy and Death</strong><br>Emir Abdelkader spent the last years of his life in Damascus, where he died in 1883. He is recognized as a hero of the Algerian resistance, an enlightened thinker and a humanist. In 1966, his remains were transferred to Algeria and rest in the El Alia cemetery.</p>



<p>His legacy lives on through his commitment to freedom, tolerance and justice.</p>
